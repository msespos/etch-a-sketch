This is a "drawing" toy created for the Odin Project.

https://msespos.github.io/etch-a-sketch/

index.html is the current version and incorporates all three versions described below.

indexBLACK.html is the original version - the user can "draw" in black only.

indexCOLORS.html is identical to indexBLACK.html except that the user "draws" in randomly selected colors.

indexSHADED.html is identical to indexBLACK.html except that the user can "shade" in boxes by repeatedly mousing over them.
